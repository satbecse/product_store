Product Store application has been developed with SpringBoot &amp; HTML,CSS,AJAX,JQuery to do CRUD operations.

It has been developed with Maven in Eclipse IDE. The project will run in the port 8080. After running this project,open the browser and go to http://localhost:8080/index.html

It will prompt to enter username and password. Please enter username as "sathish" and password as "spring". It has been hardcoded.
